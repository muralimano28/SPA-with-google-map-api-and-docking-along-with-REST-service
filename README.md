# SPA-with-google-map-api-and-docking-along-with-REST-service
This is a simple single page application that gets data of latitude and longitude from server by REST GET method and marks the location in google map.
I hosted and tested it in IIS in windows.
To use this project create a website in IIS copy these files in that website folder.
change port number to 8736 and browse the webpage (./website/Geo-location.html)from IIS.
I wrote server side code in c# and using RESTful service.
In front end I used angular JS to display location information in the dynamic table. I will include the c# files later to this repository.
I implemented docking using dock spawn library. I wrote the code in dart language in dart editor and converted it later to javascript.
I did a tutorial for consuming REST service in my blog (www.technologymentors.wordpress.com)
